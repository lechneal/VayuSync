- allow to select sorting field
- after clicking on copying, show a spinner or something on the single images to indicate they're being copied
    - allow a new selection and copy process in the meanwhile
    - it should be possible to continuously select and copy new files
    - show some kind of progress bar based on bytes
    - have the progress bar also show the estimated remaining time
- if deselecting all (e.g. going back) add support to restore previous selection (e.g. via button)


Done:
- indicate portrait vs landscape
- indicate video + show preview image
- open large preview
- set output folder via button, instead after selection
    - have the copy button start the copying - no longer folder selection
    - show which images are already in the output folder
- image preview
    - make zoom-eable
    - use memory-cached preview image as placeholder
    - video controls
