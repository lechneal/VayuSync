Major:
- bugs
    - raw takes a very long time. Show loading spinner for thumbnail -> preview, and popup cache --> full preview + exif. Somehow cancel takes a long time -- run on separate thread after all? Also not sure if cancel works, seems to fetch all exif previews first. Also cancel and restart coil if filter or sort changes. Cancel preview upon scrolling, so instead focus is on thumbnails again.
- Advanced copy features
    - back/forward with selection: if deselecting all (e.g. going back) add support to restore previous selection
    - [huge] Copy while app in background = add foreground service + android notification
    - Store state for crash, and pickup upon restart
- improve design
    - different icon for already copied (e.g. save icon)
    - hide source/destination after setting?
    - add icons to buttons
    - different button color or text if folder not selected
    - use icon as loading spinner
    - lighter placeholder images / reuse icon?
    - about page
    - rethink EXIF data (only show some, on click show next?)
    - implement recommended actions by google
    - image info background and text colors
- menu with settings:
    - recyclerview col count for landscape and larger screens? Configurable in settings?
    - disk cache size, mem cache size?
    - disable raw full preview per default (stick to exif thumbnail or use embedded jpeg, and allow click, but use dialog cached value if available) and only allow conditionally in settings?
- image preview
    - also allow moving to next/prev image
    - preload next/prev image
- add initial walkthrough


Minor:
- header:
    - setting for whether to show media type icon, store in preferences


Done:
- indicate portrait vs landscape
- indicate video + show preview image
- open large preview
- set output folder via button, instead after selection
    - have the copy button start the copying - no longer folder selection
    - show which images are already in the output folder
- image preview
    - make zoom-eable
    - use memory-cached preview image as placeholder
    - video controls
    - add image EXIF info
- bug
    - when copying movies, jpg is appended
- performance
    - show loading spinner during the initial load
    - abort image loads when opening fragment
    - abort image loads during scrolling
 - make scrollbar draggable
     - use library, do make thumb size independent of actual list items
     - https://github.com/zhanghai/AndroidFastScroll
- improve design
    - smooth image preview:
        - use thumbnail & preview memory cache key as placeholder: https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/recipes/#using-a-memory-cache-key-as-a-placeholder
        - skip thumbnail if mem cache is available? Is this even necessary?
- continuous copy
    - allow a new selection and copy process in the meanwhile
    - it should be possible to continuously select and copy new files
    - show some kind of progress bar based on bytes
    - have the progress bar also show the estimated remaining time
    - add state and notification for images that have been copied
    - after submitting images, exit from selection view
    - dynamically update image status. Use state and notify
    - Add cancel
    - reset copying image state and delete current image transfer upon cancel
- menu / settings
    - Sortby + store selection
    - Sortby: also show info in scrollbar popup
    - show info, toggle in menu
    - file type filter
    - file type filter better performance: no reload from disk
    - file type filter: if filter is active add some visual feedback
    - check if media icons should be shown
- design
    - consistent material color usage
    - revisit media icons: border instead of background?
