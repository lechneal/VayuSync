- after clicking on copying, show a spinner or something on the single images to indicate they're being copied
    - allow a new selection and copy process in the meanwhile
    - it should be possible to continuously select and copy new files
    - show some kind of progress bar based on bytes
    - have the progress bar also show the estimated remaining time
- improve design
    - menu items?
    - hide source/destination after setting?
    - add icons to buttons
    - use icon as loading spinner
    - colors?
    - revisit media icons: border instead of background?
    - lighter placeholder images / reuse icon?
    - about page
    - rething EXIF data (only show some, on click show next?)
- action bar (replacing header) / settings:
    - menu,
    - file type filter in settings? allow RAW?
    - Sortby: also show info in scrollbar popup
    - back/forward with selection: if deselecting all (e.g. going back) add support to restore previous selection
    - recyclerview col count for landscape and larger screens? Configurable in settings?
- image preview
    - also allow moving to next/prev image
    - preload next/prev image
    - animation upon opening: https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/recipes/#shared-element-transitions
- add initial walkthrough


Done:
- indicate portrait vs landscape
- indicate video + show preview image
- open large preview
- set output folder via button, instead after selection
    - have the copy button start the copying - no longer folder selection
    - show which images are already in the output folder
- image preview
    - make zoom-eable
    - use memory-cached preview image as placeholder
    - video controls
    - add image EXIF info
- bug
    - when copying movies, jpg is appended
- performance
    - show loading spinner during the initial load
    - abort image loads when opening fragment
    - abort image loads during scrolling
 - make scrollbar draggable
     - use library, do make thumb size independent of actual list items
     - https://github.com/zhanghai/AndroidFastScroll
- improve design
    - smooth image preview:
        - use thumbnail & preview memory cache key as placeholder: https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/recipes/#using-a-memory-cache-key-as-a-placeholder
        - skip thumbnail if mem cache is availble? Is this even necessary?
