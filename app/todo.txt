Major:

    - back/forward with selection: if deselecting all (e.g. going back) add support to restore previous selection
    - [huge] Copy while app in background = add foreground service + android notification
    - Store state for crash, and pickup upon restart
- improve design
    - revisit color scheme, use material design?
    - hide source/destination after setting?
    - add icons to buttons
    - different button color or text if folder not selected
    - use icon as loading spinner
    - colors?
    - revisit media icons: border instead of background?

    - about page
    - rething EXIF data (only show some, on click show next?)
    - implement recommended actiosn by google
- menu with settings:
    - menu
    - file type filter in settings? allow RAW?

    - disk cache size, mem cache size?
- image preview
    - also allow moving to next/prev image
    - preload next/prev image
- add initial walkthrough


Minor:
- header:
    - setting for whether to show media type icon, store in preferences


Done:
- indicate portrait vs landscape
- indicate video + show preview image
- open large preview
- set output folder via button, instead after selection
    - have the copy button start the copying - no longer folder selection
    - show which images are already in the output folder
- image preview
    - make zoom-eable
    - use memory-cached preview image as placeholder
    - video controls
    - add image EXIF info
- bug
    - when copying movies, jpg is appended
- performance
    - show loading spinner during the initial load
    - abort image loads when opening fragment
    - abort image loads during scrolling
 - make scrollbar draggable
     - use library, do make thumb size independent of actual list items
     - https://github.com/zhanghai/AndroidFastScroll
- improve design
    - smooth image preview:
        - use thumbnail & preview memory cache key as placeholder: https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/recipes/#using-a-memory-cache-key-as-a-placeholder
        - skip thumbnail if mem cache is available? Is this even necessary?
- continuous copy
    - allow a new selection and copy process in the meanwhile
    - it should be possible to continuously select and copy new files
    - show some kind of progress bar based on bytes
    - have the progress bar also show the estimated remaining time
    - add state and notification for images that have been copied
    - after submitting images, exit from selection view
    - dynamically update image status. Use state and notify
    - Add cancel
    - reset copying image state and delete current image transfer upon cancel
- menu / settings
    - Sortby + store selection
    - Sortby: also show info in scrollbar popup
    - show info, toggle in menu
    - file type filter
    - file type filter better performance: no reload from disk
    - file type filter: if filter is active add some visual feedback
